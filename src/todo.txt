// TODO

- attach to json server backend
- only load last 3 months by default in transaction list; scroll up to load more
- add undo functionality
- move all behaviour into container components (rename "-Container")


- add ability to import csv from bank
- store list of regex patterns and associated categories in db so user can configure automatic imports based on transaction description in csv
